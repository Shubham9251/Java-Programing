What is Stack?

--> A stack is a linear list data structure having a sequential collection of elements in
    which elements are added on the top of the stack like piles of books, etc.
    The new item can be added, or existing item can be removed only from the top of the stack.
    Stack is considered as a dynamic data structure because the size of the stack can be changed at the run time.
    The two operations can be performed on the stack, i.e., push and pop.
    Here, push operation means that a new item is inserted into the stack,
    whereas the pop operation means that the existing item is removed from the stack.
    It strictly follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle in which the recently added item will be removed first,
    and the item which is added first will be removed last.


Operations in Stack
    There are only few counted operations can be performed in Stack Data Structure in Java as mentioned below:

    1.push() : Method to push element in the Stack
    2.pop() : Method to pop element from the Stack
    3.top() : Returns the Top element from the Stack
    4.isEmpty() : The isEmpty operation can used to check whether the stack is empty or not.
    5.isFull() : The isFull Operation can be used to check whether the stack is full or not.
